SkillUp Forever shows skill-up chances, recipe costs and colour thresholds in the Professions window. Its side panel has levelling routes, shopping lists and crafted gear.

From 48 to 60 the rows re-sort by cost per skill-up, and the bracers turn green at 55.

Chance and cost, right in the window's own rows.

The route tab from 48 to 73: what to train, what to craft and where reagents come from.

The gear tab, turned on in settings: each slot shows the newest thing this character could craft for it.

Track it and the route sits beside your quests.

At the trainer, a green arrow marks the one to train next.

Hover a reagent to see how much your routes need.

## Features

- **Recipe rows and tooltips** show skill-up chance, cost and colour thresholds. The start of the difficulty range is optional.
- **Sorting** orders recipes by difficulty range start, chance or cheapest skill-ups. *Default* restores the game's categories and filters.
- **Levelling routes** list crafts and trainer visits to your target skill, including fees, tools and stations. Steps allow for unlucky skill-ups. Cheaper crafted reagents become their own steps; routes that stop short name recipes that could extend them.
- **Shopping lists** count reagents against bags and bank. Choose whether gathered materials are free or bought, track them beside quests, buy vendor stock and keep an Auctionator list up to date.
- **Trainer annotations** mark the best recipe to train next. Reagent tooltips show what tracked routes need.
- **Crafted gear** shows the newest craft for each slot, with its recipe, reagents and learning location. Enable its tab in settings.

## Prices

Each reagent uses the cheapest known vendor or Auctionator price. Visiting a vendor records its prices and reputation discounts. Materials your professions gather can count as free until you choose *Buy reagents*.

Auction prices use Auctionator's latest recorded price for reagents and crafted items. SkillUp never scans the auction house itself. Scan with Auctionator to update prices. Missing prices stay unknown and leave affected recipes out of the route.

A craft's vendor sell value comes off its cost by default. You can choose its auction value when higher, after the 5% cut. Profit shows a green `+`.

## Usage

Turn off **Show tracked professions** in settings to hide the profession tracker. Your tracked professions and skill targets are kept.

Open a profession and the numbers are already there.

- `/su` opens the settings (also in Settings > AddOns, or from the addon compartment on the minimap).
- `/su audit`, with a profession open, compares the bundled thresholds with the colours the game shows and prints any mismatch.

Thresholds come from the Forever client's recipe data; missing data shows `?`. Settings cover rows and tooltips, prices, the route and crafted gear tabs, trainer annotations, sorting, reagent tooltips and companion hints.

It also works with my other Forever addons: [Shortest Path Forever](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shortest-path-forever) walks you to its waypoints, and [Adventure Guide Forever](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adventure-guide-forever) shows each profession's next steps from its route.
